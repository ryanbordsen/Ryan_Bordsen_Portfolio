## 🔧 Projects

### **Sikorsky Supercritical Driveshaft Rig**
*Fall 2025 – Spring 2026*  
Developing and validating a helicopter-style supercritical driveshaft test rig in collaboration with Sikorsky Aircraft.  
- Integrated spline coupling to simulate real-world drivetrains  
- Performed FEA and vibration analysis in ANSYS and MATLAB  
- Conducting dynamic balancing studies with accelerometers and FFT analysis  

---

### **3D Printed Engine Project**
*Spring 2024*  
Modeled and assembled a functional 9-cylinder radial engine using FDM 3D-printed PLA components.  
- Designed and optimized in SolidWorks  
- Reduced friction and improved rotational smoothness to achieve 3400 rpm operation
